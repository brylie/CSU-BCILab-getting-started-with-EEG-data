# Colorado State University  Brain Computer Interface Lab - getting started with EEG data

Tutorial from Colorado State University BCI Lab on getting started with EEG data.

## Running the code
In order to run this notebook, you will need to install Jupyter notebooks:

https://jupyter.org/

Once Jupyter is installed and running, navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository and open the ipynb file.

## Downloading the data
We are currently discerning how to license the EEG data. In the meantime, you can download the EEG data from the CSY BCI Lab website:

http://www.cs.colostate.edu/eeg/main/data/2011-12_BCI_at_CSU

Be sure to extract the data to the `data` sub-directory, and the notebook should 'just work'.

## Getting help
If you need help, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Alternatively, you can contact the CSU BCI Lab directly:
